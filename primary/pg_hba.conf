# PostgreSQL Client Authentication Configuration File
# ===================================================
#
# This file controls: which hosts are allowed to connect, how clients
# are authenticated, which PostgreSQL user names they can use, which
# databases they can access.

# TYPE  DATABASE        USER            ADDRESS                 METHOD

# "local" is for Unix domain socket connections only
local   all             all                                     trust

# IPv4 local connections:
host    all             all             127.0.0.1/32            trust

# IPv6 local connections:
host    all             all             ::1/128                 trust

# Allow replication connections from any host (Docker network)
# The replicator user uses md5 password authentication
host    replication     replicator      0.0.0.0/0               md5

# Allow regular connections from Docker network
host    all             all             0.0.0.0/0               md5

# Note: In production, restrict the ADDRESS field to specific IPs/subnets
# Example: host replication replicator 172.18.0.0/16 md5
